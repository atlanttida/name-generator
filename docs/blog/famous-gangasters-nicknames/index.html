		<h2>Why do mobsters have nicknames?</h2>
		<p>Mobsters or gangsters use distinct nicknames to refer to a certain fellow gangster without knowing or saying their real name.<br/><br/>
		These nicknames adds to their fame, makes them memorable and sometimes even inspire fear to their competitors.</p>
		<p>Gangsters profit from having nicknames, even if they are unflattering. Even if their real name is known, using a nickname helps to conceal his identity from authorities or other outsiders.</p>

		<h2>Real Famous Gangsters & Their Nicknames</h2>
		<img src="/img/chicago-mobsters.webp" alt="Chicago Mobsters">
		<h4>"Scarface", "Big Al", "Al Brown" (Al Capone)</h4>
		<p>Probably one of the most famous gangster: Alphonse Gabriel Capone, often known as "Scarface," was an American mobster and businessman who rose to prominence as the co-founder and boss of the Chicago Outfit during the Prohibition era. His seven-year reign as a crime lord came to an end when he was sentenced to prison at the age of 33.</p>

		<h4>"Bugsy" (Benjamin Siegel)</h4>
		<p>Benjamin "Bugsy" Siegel was an American mobster who was a driving force behind the development of the Las Vegas Strip. Siegel not only was influential within the Jewish mob, but along with his friend and fellow gangster Meyer Lansky, also held significant influence within the Italian-American Mafia and the largely Italian-Jewish National Crime Syndicate. Described as handsome and charismatic, he became one of the first front-page celebrity gangsters.</p>
		<p>Siegel hated the nickname (said to be based on the slang term "bugs", meaning "crazy", used to describe his erratic behavior), preferring to be called "Ben" or "Mr. Siegel".</p>


		<h4>"Machine Gun" (Jack McGurn)</h4>
		<p>Jack "Machine Gun Jack" McGurn was a small-time boxer, Sicilian-American mobster and key member of Al Capone's Chicago Outfit.</p>

		<h4>"Chuckie The Typewriter" (Charles Nicoletti)</h4>
		<p>Charles Nicoletti, also known as "Chuckie the Typewriter", was an American mobster of the Chicago Outfit, who served as hitman under boss Sam Giancana before and after Giancana's rise and fall. Nicoletti was murdered on March 29, 1977.</p>
		<p>By the late 1950s, along with Felix Alderisio, Nicoletti was one of the most feared triggermen in Chicago and was drawing attention from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Chicago police.</p>

		<h4>"The Wizard of Odds" (Donald Angelini)</h4>
		<p>Donald Angelini was a mobster nicknamed "The Wizard of Odds" with the Chicago Outfit, a criminal organization that specialized in gambling operations.</p>
		<p>His mobster nickname "The Wizard of Odds" is clearly a reference to his involvement in gambling operations.</p>

		<h4>"Greasy Thumb" (Jake Guzik)</h4>
		<p>Jake "Greasy Thumb" Guzik was the financial and legal advisor, and later political "greaser," for the Chicago Outfit.</p>
		<p>Guzik got into an argument with a freelance hijacker named Joe Howard, who slapped and kicked him around. Incapable of physical resistance, Guzik related to Capone what had happened. Capone charged out in search of Howard. Capone drew a revolver, jammed it into Howard's face, and, after several seconds, emptied it into him.</p>
		<p>Jake Guzik appears in the HBO show Boardwalk Empire, wherein he is portrayed by Joe Caniano. His incident with Joe Howard was dramatized in an episode. In it, Guzik's bullying coincides with Capone's son being bullied in school, and it is the similarities between the two incidents that drive Capone to kill Howard.</p>

		<h4>"The Dasher" (Frank Abbandando)</h3>
		<p>Frank Abbandando (July 11, 1910 ‚Äì February 19, 1942), nicknamed "The Dasher", was a New York City contract killer (hitman) who committed many murders as part of the infamous Murder, Inc. gang.</p>
		<p>In 1928, Abbandando was convicted of beating a New York police officer and was sent to reform school in Elmira, New York, where he demonstrated skill at baseball and received the nickname "The Dasher".</p>



		<h4>"Sam Sings in the Night" (Salvatore Catalanotto)</h4>
		<p>Salvatore Catalanotto was an Italian-American mobster, and boss of Detroit's Unione Siciliana from 1920 to 1930.</p>
		<p>The "Sings in the night" nickname is a translation of a close misspelling of his last name (from the Italian "canta la notte").</p>

		<h4>"Trigger Happy", "The Fixer" (Charles Fischetti)</h4>
		<p>Charles "Trigger Happy" was a Chicago mobster, Capone bodyguard and cousin.</p>
		<p>The source of the nickname "Trigger Happy" is pretty obvious and it was his general MO for "fixing" things.</p>

		<h4>"Jimmy The Bear", "Big Bear" "Vinnie the Butcher" (Vincent Flemmi)</h4>
		<p>Vincent James Flemmi, also known as "Jimmy The Bear", was an Italian-American mobster who freelanced for the Winter Hill Gang and the Patriarca crime family. He was also a longtime informant for the Federal Bureau of Investigation. He was also the brother of government informant Stephen Flemmi.</p>
		<p>He was called the bear due to his imposing stature.</p>

		<h4>"Momo", "Mo", "Mooney", "Sam the Cigar", "Sam Flood" (Sam Giancana)</h4>
		<p>Giancana was born in Chicago to immigrant Italian parents. As a youngster, he joined the 42 Gang and established a name in organized crime that drew the attention of the famous Chicago Outfit leaders. Giancana joined the Chicago Outfit in the late 1930s. From the 1940s until the 1950s, he was in charge of Louisiana's illicit gambling, illegal booze distribution, and political rackets. Giancana worked for the Outfit in Chicago's African-American lottery payment system in the early 1940s. Giancana took over as boss of the Chicago Outfit in 1957.</p>
		<p>The character Mob Man from The <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0751164/">X-Files episode "Musings of a Cigarette Smoking Man"</a>, who is present at a planning meeting on the assassination of JFK, is likely based on Giancana.</p>

		<h4>"Chin", "The Oddfather", "Vinny","The Enigma in the Bathrobe", "The Robe", "The Real Boss of New York" (Vincent Gigante)</h4>

		<p>Gigante feigned insanity in an effort to throw law enforcement off his trail. Dubbed "The Oddfather" and "The Enigma in the Bathrobe" by the media, Gigante often wandered the streets of Greenwich Village in his bathrobe and slippers, mumbling incoherently to himself.</p>
