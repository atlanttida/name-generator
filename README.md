With gaming being such a dominant market, youâ€™d have to be living under a rock to not know about them. Platforms that carry and sell games each have their own unique [type of gamer](https://www.nickname-generator.net/blog/types-of-gamers/) identifier.

## What is nickname-generator.net?

Nickname-Generator.NET is a website containing various online name generators:

- Gamertags for boys
- Gamertags for girls
- Nicknames for boys
- Nicknames for girls

## Tech info

Technology wise, this website is developed using *NodeJS*.

Initially, the intention was have a one-page application. But, as adding more and more generators I also decided to add a blog section.

So, for the blog section I started developing a CMS system. Each post is written in HTML and pages are put together with the *Handlebars JS* templating system.

For the client side, I used *Bootstrap 5.0.0* and *Sass* to generate the CSS and *Browserify*, for bundling the JavaScript code.

*This project uses:*
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Handlebars JS](https://handlebarsjs.com/)
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- [Browserify](https://browserify.org/)
